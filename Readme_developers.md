## trackintel: version release checklist

Before you release a new version you should check/modify the following files:



- trackintel/__ version__.py -> update the version number

- docs/index.rst -> update the version number

- check setup.py if new dependencies need greater python version

After the release is tagged, __no new release with the same version number__ can be published on pypi!
